# Recycliment
## Goals
So with this project my main hope is to be able to rexyxle this giant box of filament that I have that is easily over 3kgs into high quality reusale filament. I did work on making a 3d printer before, so hopefully I should be able to make some filament for it.
## Tools
So I do not have a lot of other tools, so I am going to try to use only a 3d printer, a saw, soldering iron, and genweral hardware stuff like a hammer.
# Day 1 (5/30/24)
So today I mainly just looked an example that I can build off of; The [Lyamman Extruder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1199870/files/), is what I am mainly going to try to build off of, though I also saw a lot of other designs like the Filastuder, and I looked into a lot of videos about the topic. Namely CNC kitchenn, the Next layer, and other basic filament recycling attempts.
I learned a lot about how the filament recylcing would work, and I think that I got a basic plan for how it will look.

**Total Time Spent:3 and a half hours**
# Day 2 (6/1/25)
Today I started to work a little bit more on the CAD, and took a little more inspiration from a [diy filament factory instrctables](https://www.instructables.com/Build-your-own-3d-printing-filament-factory-Filame/). I spent way to long trying to model the auger, and I decided that I was going to use a JGY-270 to stay cheap, while also having a high RPM. I don't know when CADDING became so hard, but I think that I did make some solid progress on the Extruder.

**Total Time: 6 hours**

# Day 3 (6/2/25)
Today I mainly tried to make the extruder CAD work better, and I worked a little bit more so that I was able to add the extruder end, but I still have some more work to do with the soupler, and searching for parts. So for I am mainly  just using plumbing suppies, and a 200W PSU. I expect the total for the extruder to be a little bit over 70 dollars, and in my eyes that is actually pretty cheap. Also here is my link to the [CAD](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/f48d7279894860b6ba842288/w/ddca002676b835894c3001ed/e/6bdb128f4344ef60cc602ccf?renderMode=0&uiState=6840ed080e4e6f650fb91c5b).

*Total Time: 9 hours*


# Day4(6/4/25)
Today I spent so much of the day just researching and finding out more about filament recycling. I experimenting with trying stuff in my microwive, thought about a filament diameter measurer, and I was thinking about PID controll for my Extruder. I think that I finished the CAD for what I need, and I started with working on the spool winder. I also saw a lot of 3d print shredder, and I can just make 3 types. Onw will just be smashing the print with a hammer. Another will be grindign small sppols witha  drill, and the third wuld be suning a planar cutter like in [here](https://www.instructables.com/Low-Cost-Plastic-Shredder/). My generall idea is to first process any large peices witha hammer and the planar, and mae some pretty cource filment. The process that filament again using the drill thing to end up with pretty regular and predictable chinks. During the call I mainly worked on some more cad, and started with the filament winder.

**Total Time: 13 and a half hours. **(I think that I was supposed to add the time each entry, but if it is seprately please correct me)
