# Recycliment
## Goals
So with this project my main hope is to be able to rexyxle this giant box of filament that I have that is easily over 3kgs into high quality reusale filament. I did work on making a 3d printer before, so hopefully I should be able to make some filament for it.
## Tools
So I do not have a lot of other tools, so I am going to try to use only a 3d printer, a saw, soldering iron, and genweral hardware stuff like a hammer.
# Day 1 (5/30/24)
So today I mainly just looked an example that I can build off of; The [Lyamman Extruder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1199870/files/), is what I am mainly going to try to build off of, though I also saw a lot of other designs like the Filastuder, and I looked into a lot of videos about the topic. Namely CNC kitchenn, the Next layer, and other basic filament recycling attempts.
I learned a lot about how the filament recylcing would work, and I think that I got a basic plan for how it will look.

**Total Time Spent:3 and a half hours**
# Day 2 (6/1/25)
Today I started to work a little bit more on the CAD, and took a little more inspiration from a [diy filament factory instrctables](https://www.instructables.com/Build-your-own-3d-printing-filament-factory-Filame/). I spent way to long trying to model the auger, and I decided that I was going to use a JGY-270 to stay cheap, while also having a high RPM. I don't know when CADDING became so hard, but I think that I did make some solid progress on the Extruder.

**Total Time: 2 and a half hours**

# Day 3 (6/2/25)
Today I mainly tried to make the extruder CAD work better, and I worked a little bit more so that I was able to add the extruder end, but I still have some more work to do with the soupler, and searching for parts. So for I am mainly  just using plumbing suppies, and a 200W PSU. I expect the total for the extruder to be a little bit over 70 dollars, and in my eyes that is actually pretty cheap. Also here is my link to the [CAD](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/f48d7279894860b6ba842288/w/ddca002676b835894c3001ed/e/6bdb128f4344ef60cc602ccf?renderMode=0&uiState=6840ed080e4e6f650fb91c5b).

*Total Time: 3 hours*


# Day4(6/4/25)
Today I spent so much of the day just researching and finding out more about filament recycling. I experimenting with trying stuff in my microwive, thought about a filament diameter measurer, and I was thinking about PID controll for my Extruder. I think that I finished the CAD for what I need, and I started with working on the spool winder. I also saw a lot of 3d print shredder, and I can just make 3 types. Onw will just be smashing the print with a hammer. Another will be grindign small sppols witha  drill, and the third wuld be suning a planar cutter like in [here](https://www.instructables.com/Low-Cost-Plastic-Shredder/). My generall idea is to first process any large peices witha hammer and the planar, and mae some pretty cource filment. The process that filament again using the drill thing to end up with pretty regular and predictable chinks. During the call I mainly worked on some more cad, and started with the filament winder.

**Total Time: 4 and a half hours. **(I think that I was supposed to add the time each entry, but if it is seprately please correct me)

# Day 5 6/5/24
Today I spent way to long going down a rabbit hole of trying to reasearch about ArtME MK3S extruder. I looked into a few videos and started to scrap the lyman style extruder in favor for a more compact design like this. However after spending more than 3 hours looking into this possibility I looked into the cost and the overall complexity of the project, and I realized that making a Lymann style extruder would be a lot easier. So today I just made some very simple changes to the filament winder, and I spent way to long trying to find out how I can build one. Right now I am trying to have a filament puller and spooler at the same time, however I am debating weather I can first start with just the puller, which is probably what I will start with, because in a few extruders I saw that thry just let the filament fall to the ground. [this is another source that I saw that is really good inspo](https://reprap.org/forum/read.php?70,205005,page=1)

**Total time, 3 and a half hours**

# Day 6 8/6/25
I swear CAD should not take this long. Today I mainly tried to model my spoolwinder, and I also did a lot of research into ways taht I can add the spool winder. Right now I decided against adding a level spool, because right now I think that it is more important to save the budger to make a proper shredder, than winding upgrades can come later. I also started to work on th eCAD for all of the electronic housing, but right now I have done pretty much all of the mechanical parts, and I started researching for the BOM. As always that design will probably bue updated over the next few days, but I hope to reach a pretty final one in the next two days.

**Total Time: 2 and a half hours**
# Day 7 8/6/25
Today I speant way too long looking at different places to buy screws, comparing prices, and making most of the BOM. Here is the [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sRPHx7a0FnejNgpwdRBudMl1rintzHyC-McsPvJrDYQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0). I spent around 160 dollars so far. (I still need to update the BOM, with everything in my cart). But I expect the most expensive part to be the shredder, but first I want to make sure that my extruder can still at leaset extrude filament, before I spend so much time trying to just make the pellets for the extruder. I also did some calculations, and It should take around 4 hours to make 1 spool of filament, but I have pretty good tourque, so I do not really care about the speed, because the motor itself is actually 8 dollars, other than many 80 dollar motors that people use for an extruder, or a car windsheil one. SO I think that this was a good choice.
**Total time: 3 and a half hours hours**

# Day 8 9/6/25
Today I looked at a ton of different shredders, and I was at first thinking that I was going to make it using a planar shredder. But then after taking safety into consideration, I thought that it would pobably be better to make another type of shredder. At this point I already modelled the idea with a planar shredder, but then I had to scrap that completely and I took a long time to look at precious plastic shredders. I realized that those were really expensive, and having mo means of really making those at home, I then desided to look into mini drill powered shredders like with the one by Recreator 3d. After that I finished the entire BOM, and now all that is left before I submit is the PCB (I am thinking of making one for filament diameter sesting), and the README, so I hope to submit tomorrow.
**Total time: 4 hours.**

# Day 9 10/6/25
Today I just did all of the stuff so that I was ready to submit my design. I made the schematic, and I also worked on the readME. I was able to submit today, and I updated it with all of the necessary parts of the design. I also made a schemeatic for my design.
