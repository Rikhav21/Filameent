# Filament Extruder
## Goals
So with this project my main hope is to be able to rexyxle this giant box of filament that I have that is easily over 3kgs into high quality reusale filament. I did work on making a 3d printer before, so hopefully I should be able to make some filament for it.
## Tools
So I do not have a lot of other tools, so I am going to try to use only a 3d printer, a saw, soldering iron, and genweral hardware stuff like a hammer.
# Day 1
So today I mainly just looked an example that I can build off of; The [Lyamman Extruder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1199870/files/), is what I am mainly going to try to build off of, though I also saw a lot of other designs like the Filastuder, and I looked into a lot of videos about the topic. Namely CNC kitchenn, the Next layer, and other basic filament recycling attempts.
I learned a lot about how the filament recylcing would work, and I think that I got a basic plan for how it will look.
