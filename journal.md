# Recycliment
## Goals
So with this project my main hope is to be able to rexyxle this giant box of filament that I have that is easily over 3kgs into high quality reusale filament. I did work on making a 3d printer before, so hopefully I should be able to make some filament for it.
## Tools
So I do not have a lot of other tools, so I am going to try to use only a 3d printer, a saw, soldering iron, and genweral hardware stuff like a hammer.
# Day 1 (5/30/24)
So today I mainly just looked an example that I can build off of; The [Lyamman Extruder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1199870/files/), is what I am mainly going to try to build off of, though I also saw a lot of other designs like the Filastuder, and I looked into a lot of videos about the topic. Namely CNC kitchenn, the Next layer, and other basic filament recycling attempts.
I learned a lot about how the filament recylcing would work, and I think that I got a basic plan for how it will look.

**Total Time Spent:3 and a half hours**
# Day 2 (6/1/25)
Today I started to work a little bit more on the CAD, and took a little more inspiration from a [diy filament factory instrctables](https://www.instructables.com/Build-your-own-3d-printing-filament-factory-Filame/). I spent way to long trying to model the auger, and I decided that I was going to use a JGY-270 to stay cheap, while also having a high RPM. I don't know when CADDING became so hard, but I think that I did make some solid progress on the Extruder.

**Total Time: 6 hours**

# Day 3 (6/2/25)
Today I mainly tried to make the extruder CAD work better, and I worked a little bit more so that I was able to add the extruder end, but I still have some more work to do with the soupler, and searching for parts. So for I am mainly  just using plumbing suppies, and a 200W PSU. I expect the total for the extruder to be a little bit over 70 dollars, and in my eyes that is actually pretty cheap. Also here is my link to the [CAD](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/f48d7279894860b6ba842288/w/ddca002676b835894c3001ed/e/6bdb128f4344ef60cc602ccf?renderMode=0&uiState=6840ed080e4e6f650fb91c5b).

*Total Time: 9 hours*
